## Things to do before build the code

1) build with gradle the microservices inside the folder [libs](./libs) and [services-restapi](./managed-system/services-restapi).
2) copy the jar in a new folder where the dependency request them
3) * [config-manager](./actuators/config-manager) requires _config-parser.jar_
   * [managed-system](./managed-system) requires _config-parser.jar_ and _load-balancer.jar_
   * [rest-client](./managed-system/rest-client) requires _services-restapi.jar_
   * [managing-system](./managing-system) requires _config-parser.jar_
   * [probe](./probe) requires _config-parser.jar_ and _prometheus-scraper.jar_
   * [simple-managed-system](./simple-managed-system) requires _config-parser.jar_ and _load-balancer.jar_
4) once copied all in the correct directories, reload all gradle projects (if not recognized, link each gradle project through the _build.gradle_ file in each project)

# *RAMSES - A Reusable Autonomic Manager for MicroServicES*
MSc final thesis project by Vincenzo Riccio and Giancarlo Sorrentino ([LINK](https://github.com/ramses-sas)).

## Project composition
This project is a Self-Adaptive System made of:

1. a [managed system](./managed-system/README.md), SEFA, which is the software object of adaptation.
2. a reusable [managing system](./managing-system/README.md), RAMSES, which is the software responsible of adapting the managed system.
3. some simulated [third party services](./third-party-services/README.md) used by the managed system


## Software Architecture
The high-level software architecture is represented below.

## Installation guide
Together with the actual code of both RAMSES and SEFA, we also provide a set of ready-to-use docker images. By following the next steps, you can set up and run both systems on the same machine. 

To begin with, install [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) on your machine and run it. After the installation, we suggest to configure it with the following minimum requirements:
- **CPU**: 6
- **Memory**: 8GB
- **Swap**: 1GB

### 🔧 Windows Docker Desktop Configuration (REQUIRED)

**CRITICAL for Windows users**: Before running RAMSES-SEFA, Docker Desktop must be configured to expose the Docker API:

1. **Open Docker Desktop Settings**
2. Go to **"General"** or **"Advanced"** tab (version dependent)
3. **Enable**: `"Expose daemon on tcp://localhost:2375 without TLS"`
4. **Apply & Restart** Docker Desktop
5. **Verify**: Run `curl http://localhost:2375/version` (should return Docker version info)

**Why this is needed:** The `sefa-instances-manager` component requires direct access to the Docker API to manage container instances during adaptations. On Windows Docker Desktop, this TCP API access must be explicitly enabled.

⚠️ **Security Note**: This exposes Docker daemon on localhost:2375 without authentication. Only use in development environments.

The whole Self-Adaptive System was developed, run and tested on a 2020 Apple MacBook Air with the following specifications:
- **SoC**: Apple M1 (8-core CPU, 7-core GPU)
- **RAM**: 16GB LPDDR4
- **Storage**: 256GB on NVMe SSD
- **OS**: macOS Monterey 12.6
- **IDE**: Intellij IDEA
- **Docker** v20.10.17 (allocating 6 CPUs, 10GB Memory, 1.5GB Swap)

The **Java** version used by the project is version `16.0.2`.

The next step involves the creation of a GitHub repository (if you don’t have one yet) to be used by the _Managed System Config Server_ as the configuration repository. You can do so by forking [our repository](https://github.com/ramses-sas/config-server). Check that the `application.properties` file does not include any load balancer weight. If so, simply delete those lines and push on your repository. Once you have created your configuration repository, create an environmental variable storing its URL by running the following command, after replacing `<YOUR_REPO_URL>` with the URL of the repository you just created:
```
$ export GITHUB_REPOSITORY_URL=<YOUR_REPO_URL>
```
The `GITHUB_REPOSITORY_URL` variable should look like `https://github.com/ramses-sas/config-server.git`

Now, generate a GitHub personal access token to grant the _Managed System_ the permission to push data on your repository. You can do so by following [this guide](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token).
Once again, create an environmental variable storing your access token by running the following command, after replacing `<YOUR_TOKEN>` with the token you just created:
```
$ export GITHUB_OAUTH=<YOUR_TOKEN> 
```
The `GITHUB_OAUTH` variable should look like an alphanumeric string.

Finally, run the [SEFA+RAMSES_setup.sh](SEFA%2BRAMSES_setup.sh) bash script if you want to run _RAMSES_ together with _SEFA_. Otherwise, run the [SMS+RAMSES_setup.sh](SMS%2BRAMSES_setup.sh) bash script to run _RAMSES_ together with the _Simple Managed System_.
- Use option `-a` to specify the system architecture. The available ones are `amd64` and `arm64`. The latter is the default one.
- Use option `-l` to run only the load generator (use this option only after having the entire SAS running).

## Usage Guide
Once all the containers have been launched you can start interacting with both systems. 

To easily interact with SEFA you can open your browser and go to the URL exposed by the `sefa-web-service` container, which is visible in Docker. 

![Docker Container Example](./documents/Docker%20Container%20Example.png)

From there, you can interact with the app both as an admin, by adding and editing restaurants, or as a user, by placing orders. 

To interact with the _RAMSES_ dashboard, open your browser and go to the URL exposed by the `ramses-dashboard` container. From there you can navigate through the 3 subsections, accessible from the menu bar.
- All the managed services are under the _Home_ page, where you can see their configuration and a link to the details of each service.
- The list of the applied adaptation options is under the _Adaptation_ page, 
- You can modify the hyperparameters of _RAMSES_ from the _Configuration_ page, as well as starting/stopping the monitor routine and enabling/disabling the adaptation. Notice that the monitor routine and the adaptation are initially disabled.

From the _Home_ page you can track the availability and the average response time of each service and of their instances. Notice that these values are available only if new requests are made to the services. To generate artificial requests to _SEFA_, you can use our automatic load generator. If you did not launch it when asked by the setup script, you can instanciate it by running again the same script with the `-l` option.

## Running Simulation Scenarios

After the RAMSES-SEFA system is up and running, you can trigger various adaptation scenarios using the dedicated simulation script:

```bash
cd bash_scripts
./run_simulation.sh
```

### Understanding the Simulation Scenarios

**Important Discovery**: The simulation scenarios (scenario1-4) are actually the **rest-client application** from `ramses-sefa-SAS/managed-system/rest-client/` configured with different environment variables. They are NOT separate applications, but the same codebase with different behaviors enabled.

**Key Components in rest-client:**
- **PerformanceFakerService**: Controls artificial performance degradation
- **BenchmarksChangerService**: Triggers implementation changes via RAMSES APIs  
- **FailureInjectionService**: Injects service failures at specific times
- **AdaptationController**: Enables/disables RAMSES adaptation and monitoring

The simulation script offers the following scenarios:
- **Scenario 1 - addInstance**: Runs rest-client with failure injection enabled (5min trial, injects failure at 3min mark targeting restaurant-service)
- **Scenario 2 - changeImplementation**: Runs rest-client with threshold updating enabled (5min trial, updates DELIVERY-PROXY-SERVICE response time threshold to 150ms at ~10s)
- **Scenario 3 - changeLBWeights**: Runs rest-client with performance degradation enabled (10min trial, 1000ms delay at 1.5min, 600ms delay at 3min - both for 60s duration) - **IDENTICAL to Scenario 4**
- **Scenario 4 - shutdownInstance**: Runs rest-client with performance degradation enabled (10min trial, 1000ms delay at 1.5min, 600ms delay at 3min - both for 60s duration) - **IDENTICAL to Scenario 3**

The script also provides management options:
- **Option 5**: List currently running simulation containers
- **Option 6**: Stop all running simulations

You can run multiple simulations concurrently and monitor their effects through the RAMSES Dashboard. The simulation script can be executed multiple times without restarting the entire RAMSES-SEFA system.

## Troubleshooting and known issues

### Windows Docker Desktop Issues

**Problem**: `sefa-instances-manager` fails with "Network is unreachable" or "failed to respond" errors to `host.docker.internal:2375`

**Solution**: Enable Docker API exposure in Docker Desktop settings:
1. Docker Desktop Settings → General/Advanced
2. Enable "Expose daemon on tcp://localhost:2375 without TLS"
3. Apply & Restart Docker Desktop
4. Verify with: `curl http://localhost:2375/version`

### macOS Docker Issues

**Problem**: The Actuator component cannot directly contact the Docker interface to run or stop containers, causing `Instances Manager` container to fail.

**Solution**: Install `socat` using [this guide](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/16808543/install-socat-on-mac) and run:
```
$ socat -d TCP-LISTEN:2375,range=0.0.0.0/0,reuseaddr,fork UNIX:/var/run/docker.sock
```

### General Docker Connection Issues

If you encounter Docker API connection errors:
1. Verify Docker is running: `docker ps`
2. Check if Docker API is accessible: `curl http://localhost:2375/version`
3. Ensure proper network configuration for your OS
4. For detailed dependency information, see [SERVICE_DEPENDENCIES.md](./SERVICE_DEPENDENCIES.md)
